[vue-mdc-adapter](https://github.com/stasson/vue-mdc-adapter) is an integration of
[Material Components](https://material.io/components/web/)
and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) which follows the best practices
recommended by Google:
[Using Foundations and Adapters](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/docs/integrating-into-frameworks.md#the-advanced-approach-using-foundations-and-adapters).
This project aims to find the right balance between ease of use and customization, while sticking to the _Vue Spirit_ (approachable, versatile, and performant)
